# Future Theme Ideas

## Airbus FMS (Flight Management System)

A sixth theme inspired by the primary flight display of an Airbus aircraft.

- Main interface resembles the Airbus MCDU/PFD display
- When sending a message, an on-screen keyboard appears styled like the
  MCDU keypad used to enter flight plans
- Could include flight-plan-style navigation between sections
